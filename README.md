# Tracking of Covid-19 - Cases based on Data of the John Hopkins University

The presented Shiny App uses the Covid-19-related data of the [John Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData) for a small Shiny project.

Aim of this webapp was to be more able to compare the development of the Corona-pandemia between different countries. Furthermore, beside confirmed, dead and recovered cases active ones and some rations can be observed.

A running version of it can be experienced in a [Heroku Instance](https://covid19tracking.herokuapp.com/).
